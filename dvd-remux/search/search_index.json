Otherwise, you will not be able to find the documentation you need or pinpoint where exactly your errors are coming from.</p> <p>VapourSynth (at least the parts relevant for us) itself can be seen as consisting of three components:</p> <ul> <li>The core of VapourSynth is a frame server. It's able to chain together various functions, where each function (well, most functions) can take a sequence of video frames (or multiple sequences) together with some parameters, modify those frames in some way, and output the resulting sequence of frames (or other values).   Such sequences of frames are called video nodes, and they are computed lazily: Frames are only computed when requested, and they are only requested when they're required in other functions. This allows VapourSynth to process a video frame by frame without having to store the entire clip in memory.   Video nodes also contain frame props, which are pieces of data (key-value pairs) associated with each frame that functions can use and change as they please.</li> </ul> <p>VapourSynth offers a C/C++ api to call functions on video nodes and can load third-party plugins which provide functions.   It supports common video pixel formats, but apart from that the core of VapourSynth knows next to nothing about how a video actually looks. - On top of this architecture, VapourSynth then provides a small set of standard functions to perform various simple operations on video nodes.   Some simple examples are concatenating clips, selecting or deleting frames from clips, flipping or cropping the picture, or modifying frame props.   Some of the more sophisticated functions are the Convolution and Expr functions and the resize family of functions which can resample and convert between pixel formats.</p> <p>Furthermore, VapourSynth defines a set of reserved frame props to denote common video properties like the frame rate, sample aspect ratio, scan type, or color space. - Finally, VapourSynth implements Python bindings for its filtering architecture and provides a VSScript API which allows one to run a Python script to create, process, and output video nodes.   With these Python bindings, functions on video nodes can be called as simple member functions on the node objects, and common operations like joining or slicing can be performed using common Python operators.   Furthermore, VapourSynth provides a simple program called <code>vspipe</code> that uses the VSScript API to execute such a Python script and output the frames it generates to then be passed to an encoder.   This then results in the VapourSynth script workflow you probably know.</p> <p>Then, there are three further components in the wider VapourSynth ecosystem:</p> <ul> <li>There are dozens of VapourSynth plugins written by users (or sometimes by the authors of VapourSynth themselves) which provide all kinds of functions to process video nodes.   These are the filtering plugins that make up the real heart of VapourSynth</li> <li>There are various programs using the VapourSynth or VSScript APIs in order to somehow apply a filterchain or script to some video clip.   These range from VapourSynth script editor/preview programs like VSEdit and vs-preview and utility programs for filtering like Wobbly to programs which just use VapourSynth as a means to an end to load or process video, like mpv or (forks of) Aegisub.</li> <li>There are Python libraries that provide wrappers for various existing plugins in order to cut down on boilerplate and make them easier to use with a Pythonic mindset. This is primarily the family of JET packages.</li> </ul> <p>I'm placing a lot of emphasis on this distinction for two reasons: On one hand, understanding it can resolve many misconceptions about the ecosystem. VapourSynth isn't written in Python, it's written in C++ and provides Python bindings. It's completely possible to create API bindings for other languages (and has been done for some). VapourSynth's library of standard functions is extremely useful, but in theory it would be possible to set up an entire filterchain without using a single standard function. Python wrappers for filters are different from the filters themselves, and the two are installed and used in entirely different ways.</p> <p>On the other hand, understanding the role of each piece in the machine will help you know where you need to go to find the information you need: Want to know how to use <code>vsdenoise.BM3DCuda</code>? Well, you can check the docstrings and ask your Python language server to find out how to call it, but in the end this class is just a wrapper for the <code>bm3dcuda</code> plugin, so if you want to know what the parameters do you should read the documentation of that plugin. And if you want to know what BM3D actually does, you should read the paper the plugin is based on. But then, if you're wondering what the <code>matrix</code> argument for <code>vsdenoise</code>'s <code>BM3DCuda</code> is for, well, that refers to a color matrix and you should read the docs of the VapourSynth standard library for that (as well as those of <code>vstools</code> for a more convenient wrapper, as your language server might tell you).</p> <p>Now, after writing all of this, I should point out that this is not a perfect distinction, since for example it is also possible to implement filters directly in Python with certain more advanced techniques. Still, the point of explaining the VapourSynth ecosystem this way is not to give a perfect and complete description of it, but to help beginners understand how the various components interact and where various errors come from.</p> <p>With this in mind, here are a couple of general resources on VapourSynth:</p> <ul> <li>Full VapourSynth Docs</li> <li>List of Reserved FrameProps</li> <li>VapourSynth Standard Functions</li> <li>Resize Docs Also contains tables explaining the various matrix/primaries/transfer values</li> <li>Learn some basic Python. Use any resource you want, like this one. You need to know basic Python if you want to write VapourSynth scripts, and people will not be very patient with you if half of your questions on VapourSynth just come from a lack of Python knowledge.</li> </ul> <p>As for the various filter plugins and wrappers, there's too many of those to list here so just check their documentation.</p> <p>Again, remember that Python wrappers really are just wrappers. They're very helpful if you want to write VapourSynth scripts without too much boilerplate, but for learning how certain filters work it can be very helpful to play around with the raw plugins a bit. Understanding how the plugins work will help you understand what the wrappers do.</p>"},{"location":"resources/#filtering","title":"Filtering","text":"<p>This is a huge umbrella topic and the general advice still remains \"Find out what filters exist for a given use case and try them out.\"</p> <p>Keep in mind that there is no magical way to recover information, so any filter will be destructive to some degree. Don't use a filter if your source does not have the problem the filter is supposed to fix, or if the filter causes more issues than it fixes. Use your eyes to check for issues and do not blindly rely on automated metrics.</p> <p>Recognizing artifacts:</p> <ul> <li>guide.encode.moe's page on artifacts</li> <li>bakashots.me reference list for artifacts</li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, neither of these is complete.</p> <p>After giving these lists of artifacts it should be stressed again that you should not try to fix an artifact that isn't there. Your encoding process should be \"See what artifacts the source has, then try to fix them,\" not \"Ok, so my script should always have denoising, dehaloing, rescaling, antialiasing, debanding, and regraining.\" This is also the case when you cannot see an artifact that a source is supposed to have, even when others tell you it's there. (Though of course this means that you should try to find out what's going on and learn to spot this artifact.) If you can't see that an artifact is there, you also won't be able to judge whether your filtering fixes it.</p> <p>Finally, if your source doesn't have any significant artifacts, that doesn't mean that you should throw filters at it to somehow still improve how it looks. It just means that maybe you don't even need to encode it.</p>"},{"location":"resources/#resampling","title":"Resampling","text":"<ul> <li>Avisynth docs on resampling</li> <li>Imagemagick docs on resampling</li> <li>guide.encode.moe's page on resampling</li> <li>Docs for VapourSynth's Resize This explains the meaning of parameters like <code>src_width</code> and <code>src_top</code>.</li> <li>The resampling-related articles on ImageWorsener's page and ResampleScope's page</li> <li>Thingo I made with diagrams for all of this</li> </ul> <p>It is extremely important to realize that upsampling and downsampling are two fundamentally different operations.

This means that any horizontal resampling operation will commute with any vertical resampling operation and vice-versa.</p>"},{"location":"resources/#upsampling","title":"Upsampling","text":"<p>Conceptually, upsampling is divided into two steps</p> <ul> <li>Reconstruction: Convolve with the resampling kernel to obtain a continuous<sup>1</sup> function.

Traditional convolution-based resampling will always be a trade-off between blurring, aliasing, and ringing/haloing.</p> <p>Note that aliasing is often conflated with blocking, but technically those are two different notions: Aliasing is about low frequencies incorrectly being reconstructed to high-frequencies, while blocking (more formally referred to as anisotropy) is specifically an effect of tensor resampling (and can thus only occur in 2D or higher dimensions) and is caused by the (2D) resampling kernel not being radially symmetric. Blocking can be partially alleviated by using a polar (or EWA) kernel, while aliasing cannot.</p> <p>Here's some more resources on upsampling in particular</p> <ul> <li>For more mathematical background, read the paper by Mitchell-Netravali (and if you want to dive even deeper, read some of the papers that references, like [KEY81] and [PAR83])</li> <li>Desmos graph visualizing the upsampling process</li> <li>Plots of some common resampling kernels Note that the Blurring/Sharpness/Ringing graphs on the bottom aren't really reliable.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#downsampling","title":"Downsampling","text":"<p>Downsampling is an entirely different process from upsampling. Applying the process used for upsampling to downsampling will result in massive aliasing no matter what reconstruction kernel is used. Thus, instead of asking how to best reconstruct a continuous function out of the samples like with upsampling, the main question when downsampling is how to prevent aliasing. This is done by applying a lowpass filter to reduce the high frequences that would cause aliasing. This is also indirectly covered in the Mitchell-Netravali paper.</p> <p>With this in mind, good downsampling kernels are kernels that result in good lowpass filters like Gaussian kernels, or faster approximations to them like Hermite. In situations where you're worried about Moir\u00e9 patterns, Mitchell is also a good candidate. But as a rule of thumb, kernels with strong negative lobes will not make good downsampling kernels, even if they're fantastic upsampling kernels.</p>"},{"location":"resources/#descaling","title":"Descaling","text":"<p>The goal of a descale is to mathematically invert an upscale. Never descale a video unless you're absolutely sure that it was upscaled with those exact parameters, and that no additional post-processing was done afterwards.</p> <p>Once you know what parameters your clip was upscaled with, the signature of the descale function should tell you everything you need to call the plugin. A descale call with given <code>kernel</code> and <code>src_width</code>, <code>src_height</code>, <code>src_left</code>, <code>src_top</code> parameters will invert a <code>core.resize</code> call with the exact same values. With a fractional descale, the parity of the width/height you're descaling to makes an important difference (and changing the parity amounts to a shift by <code>0.5</code>), but apart from the parity the width/height does not matter.</p> <p>For evaluating whether your descale parameters are correct, you should check both the descale and the rescale (i.e. the upscale of the descale with the same parameters you descaled with). If the rescale's lineart looks different from the original clip, the descale cannot have been accurate. But for sharp kernels, the rescale can be very close to the original clip even for incorrect descales, so you need to check the descale too. If the descale has higher-order haloing (and usually even if it has first-order haloing<sup>2</sup>), it's not going to be correct.</p> <p>Rescale error is a decent metric to get estimates for a source resolution or shifts, but it's never the full story. Do not pick kernels based on lowest rescale error.</p> <p>Dirty borders (when they exist) can be another indicator as to whether a descale is correct, but it seems like not all dirty borders are fixed by descales. We don't really know enough about the causes of dirty borders yet to be more certain here.</p> <p>Like (tensor) resampling, descaling is done in separate steps per axis. Furthermore, the operation is linear, so (again, except for clipping) it will commute with any resampling or descale operation along the other axis. For finding descale parameters, it can be useful to analyze the horizontal and vertical axes separately, though this can make it more difficult to visually identify correct descales. Some footage can only be descaled along one axis.</p> <p>Do not descale subsampled chroma. This should be clear from the previous points but experience shows that it needs to be spelled out explicitly. Similarly, do not (horizontally) descale footage that went through the HDCAM format (and same for any other formats with subsampled luma).</p>"},{"location":"resources/#formats-and-encoders","title":"Formats and Encoders","text":"<ul> <li>Overview of the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) Standard for a brief overview of how modern coding formats work</li> <li>For more detailed information, pick up a textbook like High Efficiency Video Coding - Coding Tools and Specification</li> <li>The actual standards (H.264 and H.265) probably won't help you unless you have extremely specific questions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#x264","title":"x264","text":"<ul> <li>Overview of x264's rate control modes (without <code>mbtree</code>)</li> <li>MeGUI's x264 settings list</li> <li>MeWiki's x264 settings list</li> <li>Use the silentaperture guide for decent starter settings</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#x265","title":"x265","text":"<ul> <li>x265 is based on x264 so many of the general concepts can be carried over</li> <li>x265 docs</li> <li>Use the silentaperture guide for decent starter settings</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/#ivtc","title":"IVTC","text":"<p>IVTC is completely different from deinterlacing.

This results in a clip that ideally no longer has any combing (in practice this may not be the case due to complications like orphans, fades, etc), but will still be 30fps since it still contains duplicate frames.

Instead, they're animated in some lower resolution and then upscaled to 1080p later in the production pipeline. The original resolution can be a well-known resolution like 540p, 720p, 810p, or 900p, but it can also have more obscure dimensions like 873 or even fractional values like 843.75.</p> <p>When upscaling to 1080p, studios usually use some conventional convolutional scaling algorithm like bilinear or some bicubic kernel. The core idea of rescaling is to invert that upscaling process, and reupscale the footage using some better scaling method like a Waifu2x-based one. An example where this is especially effective is shows that have been upscaled with BicubicSharp (the bicubic kernel with b=0 and c=1), which causes strong aliasing and haloing. But even for other kernels such a rescale can be a noticeable improvement. For example, a Waifu2x-based rescale with Hermite (bicubic with b=0 c=0) as a downscaler can completely remove halos created by upscaling while still being fairly sharp.</p>"},{"location":"filtering/descaling/descaling/#why-upscale-back-to-1080p","title":"Why upscale back to 1080p?","text":"<p>You might wonder why, after descaling to the original resolution, the video should even be upscaled back to 1080p. Shouldn't it be better to just leave it at its original resolution, which is closer to the source? Well, there are two main reasons why this isn't done:</p> <ol> <li>Descaling can only be done to the luma.    The video's chroma is subsampled to 960x540, so it can no longer be descaled.    If the original resolution was, say, 720p, encoding a 720p video would mean storing    its chroma at a resolution 640x360, which would lose even more information.    If one was to instead encode with 444 chroma subsampling, the chroma would    need to be upscaled to 1280x720 which creates its own problems    (since then it'd likely still be upscaled a second time during playback).</li> <li>Shows can rarely be descaled completely.    Often, some elements of shows were added in 1080p after upscaling.    One common example is credits in openings or endings.    It's also possible for different scenes to have different native resolutions,    or for some scenes to not be descaleable at all.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"filtering/descaling/descaling/#descaling-theory","title":"Descaling Theory","text":"<p>As explained above, the difficult part in descaling is finding the parameters used to upscale (in fact, it's easy to make guesses at these parameters, the hard part is determining whether one's guess is correct). These \"parameters\" involve the following:</p> <ul> <li>The original width and height.   These can be integers, but they can also be fractional values when the video was cropped after resizing or   when the resize used a different sample grid model (see below).</li> <li>The sample grid model used when upscaling.   VapourSynth's resize functions and the <code>descale</code> plugin use the common \"match edges\" model   (see the entropymine article for an explanation of these terms).   When a video is upscaled from an integer resolution like 720p using a different model like \"match centers\",   this is equivalent to upscaling with a non-integer source width/height (e.g. a <code>src_height</code> of <code>1080 * 719/1079 \u2248 719.67</code>)   using a \"match edges\" model.   Hence, when descaling such an upscale, these non-integer dimensions would need to be passed to the <code>descale</code> plugin.</li> <li>The kernel used for upscaling. Determining this is often the most difficult part.</li> <li>How the original upscale handled the edges of the frame,   i.e. whether it implicitly padded width values of zero, mirrored the image, or did something else entirely.</li> <li>Any shifts that were applied when upscaling.</li> <li>Any post-processing that was applied after upscaling.   In the vast majority of cases, post-processing after upscaling implies that your source is not descaleable,   but if the post-processing was a somewhat reversible (ideally linear) function like convolutional sharpening, you might still have a chance.</li> <li>What color space the video was upscaled in, i.e. what color space conversions were performed after the upscale.   Note that a nonlinear color space conversion after upscaling can make a fully accurate descale impossible.</li> <li>Whether there are any non-descaleable elements (e.g. credits) in the video or elements that'd otherwise negatively affect the descale   and should be masked out in the descale (e.g. clipped pixels).</li> <li>The order in which the video was upscaled (horizontally, then vertically, or vice-versa).   Since resampling is linear this is usually irrelevant, but it becomes relevant when dealing with clipped values.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, these parameters (including whether the video is descaleable at all) can vary between scenes or frames, and the parameters for a horizontal descale can be different from the parameters for a vertical descale. In particular, it's possible for a source to be descaleable only along one axis. An example for this is footage that went through the HDCAM format, which subsamples luma to a width of 1440 (from 1920). Such footage will not be horizontally descalable to its original resolution (maybe to 1440 if you're lucky), but can sometimes still be descaled vertically. Whether a source like this is worth descaling is a separate question.</p> <p>The following sections will explain some of these parameters in more detail, as well as how to attempt to determine them.</p>"},{"location":"filtering/descaling/descaling/#source-dimensions","title":"Source Dimensions","text":"<p>The source dimensions are, of course, the essential part of rescaling. Luckily, they're also fairly easy to approximately determine. There exist two methods for determining source resolutions:</p> <ol> <li>The brute-force method, which simply tries descaling the source clip to a large set of resolutions,    scales them back up with the same kernel, and graphs the total error relative to the original image.    It turns out empirically that the resulting graph will show a spike around the \"correct\" resolution even    when the kernel used in the descales is not the correct one.</li> <li>Frequency-based methods, which exploit the behavior of convolutional resampling in the frequency domain.    These include various different methods: On one hand, simply looking at the size of the \"center blob\"    in a two-dimensional frequency plot of an image can already give an indication of whether this image was upscaled,    and (very) approximately by how much.    A slightly more quantitative method is to take the one-dimensional discrete cosine transform of every row (resp. column)    and sum the entry-wise absolute values across all columns (resp. rows).    Due to how resampling behaves in frequency space, the resulting graph will show a spike at the source resolution.

In the end, every descale needs to be evaluated manually.

ALWAYS manually verify that your candidate parameters are correct, using the methods explained below.</p> <p>Evaluating a descale entails</p> <ol> <li>Comparing a rescale of the descaled clip with the same parameters to the original clip.    This is the most obvious necessary condition for a descale to be correct.    For the theoretical perfectly descaleable clip, these two should match exactly.    In practice, there can be some slight differences due to quantization and compression noise,    but nonetheless if a same-kernel rescale significantly differs from the original clip,    that always means that the descale cannot be correct.</li> <li>Inspecting the descale itself. An accurate descale will have line-art that looks \"clean\" at least to some degree.    If your descale has higher-order haloing or very fuzzy-looking lines, it's likely not correct even if the rescale is very close to the descale.    Even first-order haloing in a descale is usually an indication of an incorrect descale,    but to our knowledge it's possible in theory (but fairly rare in the wild) for footage to have been sharpened before upscaling.</li> </ol> <p>Comparing the rescale to the source or inspecting a descale is best done around sharp lines. Exactly horizontal or exactly vertical lines are especially good indicators of rescale quality, since around such lines the descale is essentially purely one-dimensional. The same is true for borders when the video was upscaled using zero-padding: here it's crucial to check whether descaling with <code>border_handling=1</code> fixes the borders or not (and whether the rescale matches the original borders).</p> <p>When searching for descales it can and will happen that you simply will not find any set of parameters giving you satisfying results, even if you find one or more parameters that get you closer than any other ones.

This means that the stored video dimensions differ from the intended display dimensions. A typical NTSC DVD stores video at 720\u00d7480 pixels (a 3:2 aspect ratio), but displays it at either widescreen (16:9) or standard definition (4:3) aspect ratios.</p> <p>To achieve the correct display size, DVDs make use of a Sample Aspect Ratio (SAR), also known as a Pixel Aspect Ratio (PAR). This value tells the player how much to stretch each pixel. The system was designed for CRT televisions, which had overscan, meaning they would stretch and slightly crop the edges of the image, which allowed the image to reach its intended Display Aspect Ratio (DAR).</p> Understanding Aspect Ratio Math <p>To properly handle DVD aspect ratios, we need to understand three key components:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Display Aspect Ratio (DAR):     The final width-to-height ratio     of the displayed picture.</p> <ul> <li>Widescreen content:   DAR = 16:9 (~1.778:1)</li> <li>Fullscreen content:   DAR = 4:3 (~1.333:1)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The active area of the frame.</p> <ul> <li>This represents   the actual visible picture area   for which the DAR is defined,   intended for display   on traditional CRT TVs.   This area may exclude   some valid picture data   due to production inconsistencies.

This is because the frames will be displayed as its storage as square pixels (720\u00d7480, SAR 1:1).</p> <p>All the frames given as examples are shown as square pixels, and the end result should look like the video would be displayed on a CRT monitor.</p> <p>The following methods can be used to help determine the correct SAR values. Ideally, you should cross-reference the results of as many of these methods as possible to derive the most accurate SAR values.</p> <p>SAR heuristic methods</p> Faded columnsCircle methodLogo methodGround Truth <p>NTSC Active Area Standards</p> <p>NTSC has two common active area standards that are very similar:</p> <ul> <li>710.85\u00d7486 (typically from analog transfers)</li> <li>704\u00d7480 (more common in digital sources)</li> </ul> <p>While the faded columns method below can help identify the active area, additional analysis may be needed to definitively determine which standard is being used.</p> <p>One way to determine the active area is by looking for faded columns on the edges of the frame. These faded borders are intentionally added to mark the boundaries of the active picture area.</p> <p></p> <p>To get the active area width:</p> <ol> <li>Identify the fade width on the left and right sides (ignoring the top and bottom)</li> <li>Subtract both fades from the total frame width</li> </ol> <p>The easiest way to get the fade width is to use vspreview to display the frame. You can immediately load a video using the following terminal command:</p> <pre><code>vspreview &lt;video_file&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>This will open the video in the vspreview window. You can then navigate to the right side of the window and click on \"Misc\". This will open a toolbar where you can crop the frame on each side. Crop the left and right sides until the faded columns are no longer visible.</p> <p></p> <p>For example, if you have:</p> <ul> <li>Total frame width: 720 pixels</li> <li>Left fade: 9 pixels</li> <li>Right fade: 7 pixels</li> </ul> <p>The active area width would be: <code>720 - 9 - 7 = 704 pixels</code></p> <p>Once you know the active area and display aspect ratio (DAR), you can determine the correct SAR using the reference table above.</p> <p>In this example frame:</p> <ul> <li>Active area: 704\u00d7480 (crop 9px left, 7px right)</li> <li>DAR: 4:3</li> <li>Therefore SAR: 10:11</li> <li>Final display resolution: 704\u00d7528</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Another method to determine the correct SAR is by finding objects in the frame that should be perfectly circular, like clocks, wheels, or logos.</p> <p>The process is straightforward:</p> <ol> <li>Find a frame with an object that should be a perfect circle</li> <li>In an image editor, overlay a perfect circle on top of the object</li> <li>Test different standard SAR values until the object matches the overlay</li> </ol> <p></p> <p>The image above demonstrates a perfect match using a SAR of 2560:2133, which corresponds to a 711\u00d7480 active area. When the overlay aligns perfectly with the object, you've found the correct SAR.</p> <p>Another approach is to compare text or studio logos against reference images. Many studio logos can be found online in their original square pixel form, which makes them useful reference points.</p> <p>The process is similar to the circle method, but uses a studio logo or text as the reference instead of a circle. You overlay the reference logo on top of the frame and adjust the SAR until they match perfectly.</p> <p></p> <p>In this example, matching the logo gave us a SAR of 4320:4739 (equivalent to a 710.85\u00d7486 active area). This level of precision would be difficult to achieve using just the faded column method.</p> <p>Upscales are not valid references</p> <p>Note that SD upscales do not qualify as valid reference sources, as they are not native square pixel sources. They had to go through the same process as you are doing now, and it's very likely that they were handled incorrectly!</p> <p>If you have access to a natively square pixel source (such as a Blu-ray release), you can use it as a reference to determine the correct SAR.</p> <p>This method is particularly useful for episodes that were only released on DVD when Blu-rays exist for other episodes, such as DVD-only OVAs.</p> <p>The process works as follows:</p> <ol> <li>Downscale the Blu-ray to 864\u00d7486</li> <li>Crop the image to 864\u00d7480 (matching the DVD master's crop)</li> <li>Test different SAR standards    until the DVD matches the Blu-ray perfectly</li> </ol> I have black bars at the top/bottom! Do I need to change the height? <p>The SAR's standard active area height should be the height taken into account for this calculation.</p> <p>These checks can all be performed using the following Vapoursynth code snippet:</p> <pre><code>from vstools import Sar, mod4\nfrom vskernels import Bicubic\n\nsar = Sar.from_ar(\n    &lt;dar_num&gt;, &lt;dar_den&gt;, &lt;active_width&gt;, &lt;active_height&gt;\n)\n\nif sar &gt; 1:\n    width, height = mod4(clip.width * float(sar)), mod4(clip.height)\nelse:\n    width, height = mod4(clip.width), mod4(clip.height / float(sar))\n\nclip_resized = Bicubic.scale(\n    clip, width, height, keep_ar=True, sar=sar\n)\n</code></pre> Why use Vapoursynth? <p>Image editors are not capable of properly ensuring the active area gets stretched and cropped correctly, so we need to use a tool that can do this.</p> <p>The <code>vskernels</code> <code>Kernel</code> classes are all capable of handling the scaling and cropping correctly, including proper subpixel cropping and SAR adjustments that are essential for anamorphic content.</p> <p>Replace the following keys:</p> <ul> <li><code>&lt;dar_num&gt;</code> with the DVD's DAR numerator</li> <li><code>&lt;dar_den&gt;</code> with the DVD's DAR denominator</li> <li><code>&lt;active_width&gt;</code> with the SAR's standard active area width</li> <li><code>&lt;active_height&gt;</code> with the SAR's standard active area height</li> </ul> <p>Once you've determined the correct SAR values, you can print out the new display dimensions by printing the following values at the end of the script:</p> <pre><code>new_sar = sar * clip.width / clip.height\nprint(f\"New display width: {new_sar.numerator}\\nNew display height: {new_sar.denominator}\")\n</code></pre> Understanding SAR calculations and display dimensions <p>The formula multiplies the SAR by the stored frame's width/height ratio to calculate the intended display ratio.</p> <p>For example, using a 720\u00d7480 NTSC DVD with a SAR of 2560:2133:</p> <pre><code>Fraction(2560, 2133) * Fraction(720, 480) = Fraction(1280, 711)\n</code></pre> <p>This results in a fraction that equals roughly 1.8, which matches the 16:9 DAR. While this could also be expressed as 853\u00d7480, keeping it as a reduced integer fraction like 1280:711 is preferable, since players treat these values as a ratio rather than actual final dimensions. Using larger integers in the ratio helps avoid rounding errors that could occur with smaller numbers.</p>"},{"location":"sources/dvd-remux/#setting-container-metadata","title":"Setting container metadata","text":"<p>Now that you've determined the correct SAR values, you can apply them to the video.
