!!! warning "This page is incomplete!"

It can be difficult
to determine the native resolution
of an anime.
Many encoders
have already done
a lot of research themselves,
and this page documents the found results.

This table contains
the following information:

1. The show name,
   with a link to its AniDB page.
   Seasons are separated
   into their own rows.
   This may extend
   to certain specials too.
2. The known native resolutions
   and kernels.
   This may be a list
   of multiple resolutions
   with additional information.
   in certain cases
   If a kernel is unknown,
   "unknown" will be written down instead.
3. A confidence rating
   on whether this show
   is descaleable
   with current known tools
   and techniques.
4. Additional notes
   and information.

## Known Native Resolutions

!!! danger "Attention"
    Our knowledge on descaling
    is ever-improving.
    Some of these findings may be inaccurate
    and outdated!
    Take them with a grain of salt,
    and do your due diligence.
    Verify everything yourself
    before applying a descale
    to your encode!
